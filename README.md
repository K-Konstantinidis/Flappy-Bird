# Flappy-Bird
A Java project that creates a game like flappy bird with a score counter.

A java project for a game like Flappy Bird.

This is a java project that creates the game Flappy Bird, but instead of a Bird you have a RED rectangle. After you run the "Main" class, the game will appear to your screen.

The game will start after you press the Space key.

You can make the bird jump by pressing the Space key. While you are playing the game, if you pass through the middle of the pipes, your score gets update by +1.

The game is the original Flappy Bird where if the bird hits a pipe or the top of the screen, then it's game over. In the end screen you will see a Game Over message and the score. 
The score is the amount of pipes you went through before losing.

For more information about how the code works, there are lots of comments in the .java files to help you understand everything and follow along with ease!
